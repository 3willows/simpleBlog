I was trying to make a Promise object return an ordinary value (e.g. a number or a string), but failed.

And then I realised that Promises are never intended to return values other than Promises.  Otherwise how can one “chain” then with .thens?

I can do what I wanted to do with this instead.

 ```js

// declare a variable without initialising it

let newValue

// declare and initialise a promise

const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
resolve("foo");
});

// assign the value of the resolved promise to the variable

myPromise.then(value => {newValue = value})

(Carriage return)

console.log(newValue)

```
