My answer is no.  The attention economy has closed off a route that was available as recently as a decade ago.

Background: I came across an unusually patient and helpful answer by [adsy](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1086398/adsy) on StackOverflow, which led me to this [article](https://www.adam-thomas.co.uk/blog/how-do-i-become-a-software-engineer/
).


After reading it, it struck me that the way people first experience computers and programming has transformed in the last 20 years.

adsy got into programming the early 2000s.  The dot-com bubble had burst.  Social media and the i-phone were yet to come.  Computers were still a relatively niche interest.  It was still possible for people to tinker with things, get better, and slide into programming.

By the 2020s (when I started), smartphones were a daily staple.  The attention economy was in full swing.  The Silicon Valley was already a well-beaten track to (lasting) fame and fortune.  The 4-hour week was already old news and everyone was busy with their side-hustles.

It stands to reason that the skills and habits needed to get started in the new normal is different from the past.  

In the 2000s, it was possible to get into computing just by tinkering and experimentation.  But now there is so much that one could tinkle with, it is easy to lose the way.  

Worst, “building things” has now become a key social signal (among tech circles).  One’s sense of achievement of making things are now inevitably intertwined with some kind of social positioning of ourselves against the influencers we follow. 

With so much choice (and advertisement) in front of us, just digging in and consuming may not be good enough.  Habits that served us and hunter-gatherers are unhelpful when we have McDonalds.  Arguably now more than ever before, one needs to pick and choose.

A different kind of learning strategy may be required.  Habits and instincts that served us well in an age of relative information scarcity may not work in an age of tailor-made over-abundance.
