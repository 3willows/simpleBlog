Quick test: what do these code snippets do? 

```js
const a = new Promise(function (a) {
  a
})

const b = new Promise(function (b) {
  b("success")
})

const c = new Promise(function (a, b) {
  b("failure")
})

const d = Promise.resolve("success")

const e = Promise.reject("failure")

const f = new Promise(function (a, b) {
  a("success")
  b("failure")
})

const g = new Promise(function (a, b) {
  b("failure")
  a("success")
})

const h = new Promise(function (a, b) {
  throw new Error()
})

const i = new Promise(function (a, b) {
  a()
})

const j = new Promise(function (a, b) {
  b()
})

const k = (number) => {
  return new Promise(function (a, b) {
    a(number * 2)
  })
}
```

Check by opening the console in your browser and test with e.g.

```js
x.then(console.log).catch(alert)
```

Some points that were consolidated for me after the exercise:

- "Promise" is not the same as "promise". What I need to reach for is the "Promise()" constructor: "promise" is just the conventional name assigned to the promise object.

- > Promise() can only be constructed with new. Attempting to call it without new throws a TypeError. --- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/Promise#syntax)

- Promise() takes an executor as its paramater. The executor receives two functions as parameters: resolveFunc (1st parameter) and rejectFunc (2nd parameter).

```js
x.then((result) => {
  console.log(result)
  return result
})
  .then((result) => console.log(result))
  .catch((result) => console.log(result))

z.then(() => {
  return "hello"
}).then(alert)
```
